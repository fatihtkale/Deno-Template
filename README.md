# Rest API Template.

## What does it come with?
This template does not come with pre installed packages, only oak.

But what have done is...

 1. Routing
 2. Types
 3. Very simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for routing.
 4. Small logger of what views gets accessed and the status code!

## Run
For running this project you would need to input 1 very small command

```js
denon start
```

If you want to use REAL data you can go a head and delete the "Mock" folder and remove it from the controllers part!
